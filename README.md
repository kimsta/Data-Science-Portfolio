## Featured Projects

### 1. High-Performance Travel Network Analysis (Master's Thesis)
For my Master's thesis, titled *"An Algorithmic Comparison for Efficiently Computing Travel-Time Matrices on a Multi-Modal Network,"* I am expanding on a project I began during my traineeship at VATT. The goal is to solve a computational bottleneck in economic research by developing and evaluating a high-performance Python pipeline for large-scale network analysis.

* **Foundational Work & Preliminary Results:** The foundational data pipeline was partly engineered during my traineeship and has already yielded a strong **preliminary ~72x performance speedup** over baseline methods by leveraging C-backed libraries like `igraph`.

* **Ongoing Thesis Research:** The current thesis work focuses on a rigorous comparative analysis of different algorithmic paradigms. This research evaluates the trade-offs between classic algorithms (**Dijkstra, A***), an advanced exact method (**Contraction Hierarchies**), and a learned approximation method (**Graph Neural Networks**).

* **Public Demo:** A public notebook demonstrating the core optimization technique from the foundational work **[is available here](https://github.com/kimsta/Python-Graph-Benchmark)**.
* **Tech Stack:** Python, PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric, geopandas, python-igraph, graph-tools, NetworkX.


### 2. NLP Pipeline for Automated Text Classification
In a separate trainee project at VATT, I designed and delivered a complete two-stage NLP pipeline to classify thousands of unstructured, Finnish-language free form text entries.

* **My Contribution:** I managed the end-to-end workflow. This included a modern approach to programmatic labeling using the Google Gemini API, and training `spaCy` models for both stages of the pipeline.
* **Outcome:** The first-stage binary filter achieved a **93% F1-score**, and the final multi-label classifier achieved a **~90% F1-score** on its primary categories, successfully automating a massive manual data-structuring task.
* **Public Demo:** A public version of this pipeline, demonstrating the same techniques on a Finnish sentiment dataset, **[is available here](https://github.com/kimsta/spaCy_NLP_Sentiment_Demo)**.
* **Tech Stack:** Python, spaCy, scikit-learn, Pandas, Google Gemini API.

### 3. Statistical Deep Dive into Padel Performance
This personal project is a comprehensive case study in applying a full statistical workflow—from data wrangling to a deployed web application—to a sparse, real-world dataset of amateur padel match results.

* **My Contribution:** I executed this project end-to-end, from raw data collection and wrangling to the final deployment of an interactive web application.

* **Key Methods:** The core of the project is a dual-paradigm statistical analysis. I used **frequentist** methods (hypothesis tests, power analysis) to establish statistical significance and complemented it with **Bayesian inference** (Beta-Binomial model) to quantify the uncertainty of each player's skill level.

* **Outcome & Deliverables:** The analysis produced a robust player ranking system, which is delivered via a live **[R Shiny App](https://kimst.shinyapps.io/Padel_Stats_Explorer/)**. The complete source code and a detailed statistical report are available in the **[project repository](https://github.com/kimsta/Padel_Project)**.

* **Tech Stack:** R, Shiny, R Markdown, Tidyverse, ggplot2, knitr, pwr.

### 4. Automated ANOVA Pipeline for BioMedicum Helsinki
As part of a five-person team on a Master's level Data Science Project, we developed a user-friendly statistical pipeline in R for the Koistinaho Lab to automate the analysis of complex experimental data.

* **My Contribution:** I took the lead on developing the core R analytics engine. My primary responsibilities were to architect the data cleaning and validation functions and to implement the primary analysis logic, which automatically selects one of four distinct ANOVA models based on user input. I also communicated directly with the client-scientist to translate their research needs into technical requirements for the pipeline.
* **Outcome:** Our team delivered a tool that provides researchers with a reproducible and highly efficient workflow, significantly reducing manual analysis time.
* **Public Demo:** An R Markdown file demonstrating the core logic of this automated pipeline, **[is available here](https://github.com/kimsta/R_Automated_ANOVA)**.
* **Tech Stack:** R, Tidyverse, rstatix, broom.

### 5. Enterprise Revenue Forecasting for CGI Finland
As part of a university course project, our team developed a revenue forecasting model for CGI Finland based a large historical transaction dataset.

* **My Contribution:** I designed and implemented the core time series forecasting model using Python (Pandas, Statsmodels). My model used seasonal decomposition to accurately identify and predict complex trends and seasonal patterns.
* **Outcome:** The model was successfully delivered and accepted by the client, demonstrating a measurable improvement in forecast accuracy over their existing methods. The project was later decommissioned following internal organizational changes at CGI.
* **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Statsmodels.
