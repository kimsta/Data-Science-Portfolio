# Master's in Data Science Coursework at the University of Helsinki

This repository contains a selection of code, exercises, and projects completed as part of my Master's program in Data Science at the University of Helsinki.  It demonstrates my skills in machine learning (including regression, classification, clustering, and deep learning), statistical modeling, data visualization (using R and Python libraries), and data wrangling.

## Projects

*   **Revenue Forecasting Model for CGI Finland:** [Link to CGI-Revenue-Forecasting folder](CGI-Revenue-Forecasting) - Developed, as part of a three-person team, a revenue forecasting model and application for CGI Finland (ICT) using a large historical transaction dataset.  My primary contributions focused on the core time series forecasting model, implemented in Python using libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Statsmodels.  The model incorporated seasonal decomposition to capture trends and seasonality in the data.  I also contributed to defining UI requirements, testing the application, and creating user and installation documentation.  The client accepted the model, and it is currently being used for user feedback collection while shadowing their existing forecasting methods. Preliminary results suggest improved accuracy and potential efficiency gains.  Due to data confidentiality agreements, the code for this project cannot be shared publicly. However, I am happy to discuss the technical details of the project and my contributions in more detail.

*   **Atmospheric Vapor Pressure Prediction:** [Link to shared GitHub repository](https://github.com/withoutglue/predicting_saturation_vapour_pressure) - Participated in a Kaggle competition for a University of Helsinki Data Science Master's course, predicting molecular vapor pressure using R. My contributions included:
    *   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using R and visualization libraries.
    *   Feature engineering and selection (including PCA).
    *   Model training and evaluation (Linear Regression, PCR, Random Forest, SVR).  SVR was selected as the final model based on R-squared.
    *   Achieved a top 50% ranking in the competition.


## Exercises
