# Machine Learning Exercises

This folder contains selected machine learning exercises from my Master's coursework at the University of Helsinki.  These exercises cover various topics in machine learning and demonstrate my skills in applying different techniques using R.  More exercises may be added in the future.

## Exercises

*   **Exercise 1:** [The exercises cover topics such as linear regression, model evaluation, bias-variance tradeoff, and regularization.  See the R Markdown files for details.] - `IML-set1.Rmd`
*   **Exercise 2:** [Brief description of Exercise 2] - `Exercise2.Rmd`
*   **Exercise 3:** [Brief description of Exercise 3] - `Exercise3.Rmd`
*   **(More exercises will be listed here as they are added)**

## How to Run

Each `.Rmd` file contains the exercises and their solutions.  To run the exercises:

1.  Ensure you have the required R packages installed.  See the individual `.Rmd` files for a list of required packages.  You can install the packages using `install.packages(c("package1", "package2", ...))`.
2.  Open the `.Rmd` file in RStudio.
3.  Knit the `.Rmd` file to generate the output (e.g., PDF or HTML).

## Data

The data used in the exercises is either included with the exercises or is available from publicly accessible sources.  See the individual `.Rmd` files for details on the data source.
